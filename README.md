I used the load_cancer_data set from sk.learn and used it to create predictive models that displayed the accuracy of certain test that were ran to gather this data. 
By placing this data in this dataframe, I was able to create plots that showed the testing accuracy of the treatments. 
I used Numpy, Pandas, and Seaborn to help create confusion matrixes, line graphs, and dot plots. 
This was all placed in a jupyter notebook.
